# Telco Churn Prediction:
# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This machine learning project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the telecom service) based on their demographics, usage patterns, and account information. Early churn prediction helps businesses retain valuable customers through timely interventions.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. This project uses supervised machine learning models to identify customers at high risk of leaving the service, based on historical data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and explore the Telco churn dataset
- Clean and preprocess data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Apply feature engineering techniques
- Train multiple ML models and evaluate their performance
- Visualize important features
- Interpret results using SHAP
- (Optional) Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask

## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA

- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn.
- **Tenure** (customer duration) is strongly negatively correlated with churn.
- **Electronic check** payment type has higher churn compared to other methods.
